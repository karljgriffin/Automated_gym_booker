# Automated_gym_booker
The gym in the university in which I am studying only allocates a certain number of places for each gym slot, and the booking opens exactly three hours in advance. As a result, it books out almost instantly and people often don't get a spot. This simple script automatically books the gym slot that you specify if you run it just prior to the booking opening.
